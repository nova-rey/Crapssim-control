"""
Action Envelope schema (v1.0)

Every action emitted by CrapsSim-Control (from templates now, rules later)
must conform to this shape so downstream consumers (CSV exporter, UIs, tests)
can rely on a single contract.

Envelope (per action):
    {
      "source": "template" | "rule",                  # producer of the action
      "id": "template:<mode>" | "rule:<name-or-idx>", # stable identifier
      "action": "set" | "clear" | "press" | "reduce" | "switch_mode",
      "bet_type": "pass_line" | "place_6" | "odds_6_pass" | None,
      "amount": float | None,                          # None when not applicable
      "notes": str                                     # brief reason or context
    }

Conventions:
- IDs are namespaced ("template:Main", "rule:press_on_point", "rule:#2").
- Use amount=None when not meaningful; don't overload with 0.
- Additional optional fields may be added in future minor revisions (additive).
