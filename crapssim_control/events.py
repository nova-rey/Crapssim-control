    """
    Derive a semantic event from previous and current game state snapshots.

    Both `prev` and `curr` are dict-like objects with (at least) these keys:
      - 'comeout' : bool        -> whether the roll is a comeout roll
      - 'total'   : int         -> the dice total for the current roll
      - 'point_on': bool        -> whether a point is currently on (after roll)
      - 'point_num': Optional[int] -> the current point number if on, else None
      - 'just_est': Optional[bool]  -> True if this roll just established the point

    Returns a dict with:
      - 'event'  : str (primary key expected by tests)
      - 'type'   : str (alias for backward compatibility)
      - 'roll'   : int (the current total)
