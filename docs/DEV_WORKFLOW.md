CrapsSim-Control ‚Äî Collaborative Development Workflow

Purpose: define how phases, checkpoints, and handoffs work between Rey and Nova. This document lives alongside the code as the project‚Äôs memory spine.

‚∏ª

üß≠ 1. Guiding Principles
	‚Ä¢	Incremental, never brittle. Each change should be small enough to roll back with one commit.
	‚Ä¢	State is sacred. The CSC_SNAPSHOT.yaml file is the single source of truth for where we are.
	‚Ä¢	One brain, two modes.
	‚Ä¢	Chat Mode ‚Üí design, reasoning, and decision log.
	‚Ä¢	Agent Mode ‚Üí mechanical execution (edits, tests, exports).
	‚Ä¢	Phase ‚âà one thread. A new chat thread begins at each phase, seeded by the current snapshot.
	‚Ä¢	Checkpoint = rhythm. Every checkpoint gets its own commit, its own agent run, and a short summary added to the Bible.

‚∏ª

üß© 2. File Structure

docs/
  CSC_BIBLE.md          ‚Üê long-form narrative, one chapter per phase
  CSC_SNAPSHOT.yaml     ‚Üê machine-readable current state
  PHASE_CHECKLIST.md    ‚Üê template filled per checkpoint
  DEV_WORKFLOW.md       ‚Üê this file
baselines/
  phase0/‚Ä¶              ‚Üê test artifacts


‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Phase Anatomy

Each phase has a clear theme and a bounded scope (e.g., ‚ÄúPhase 2 ‚Äî Single-Source Modules‚Äù).

Step	Responsibility	Output
1	Brief (Rey ‚Üí Nova)	Goals, guardrails, files to edit
2	Design sync (chat)	Finalized plan, no code yet
3	Agent run	File edits, tests, artifacts
4	Review (chat)	Diff summary, verification
5	Snapshot update	CSC_SNAPSHOT.yaml refreshed
6	Bible chapter	CSC_BIBLE.md gains one new section


‚∏ª

üß± 4. Checkpoint Routine

Each checkpoint has its own PHASE_CHECKLIST.md copy filled out before work begins.
	1.	Pre-flight
	‚Ä¢	Tests green
	‚Ä¢	Snapshot loaded
	‚Ä¢	Known issues reviewed
	2.	Agent run (one per checkpoint)
	‚Ä¢	Perform all edits and tests atomically
	3.	Review & Diff
	‚Ä¢	Summarize deltas in chat
	‚Ä¢	Verify outputs against baseline
	4.	Commit
	‚Ä¢	Message format: P<phase>C<checkpoint>: <short title>
	5.	Update snapshot & Bible
	‚Ä¢	Increment checkpoint number
	‚Ä¢	Record decisions and notes

‚∏ª

üß† 5. Handoff Protocol

When threads reset or a new phase begins:
	1.	Start with a Handoff Brief:
	‚Ä¢	Attach CSC_SNAPSHOT.yaml and CSC_BIBLE.md.
	‚Ä¢	List next checkpoint‚Äôs intent.
	2.	New thread reads both ‚Üí immediate context restore.
	3.	Optional quick repo scan if structural drift occurred.

This turns the first five messages of every new thread into instant orientation instead of re-sync chatter.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è 6. Agent-Use Policy
	‚Ä¢	Frequency: one run per checkpoint, optional run at phase close.
	‚Ä¢	Scope: mechanical work only ‚Äî file edits, tests, CI tweaks, baseline exports.
	‚Ä¢	Safety: never combine semantic design changes and mechanical refactors in the same run.
	‚Ä¢	Post-run ritual: update snapshot, summarize deltas, commit, tag.

‚∏ª

ü™∂ 7. CSC Bible Chapters

At the end of every phase, add a new section to CSC_BIBLE.md:

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Single-Source Modules
**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Objective:** merge *_rt.py variants ‚Üí canonical modules  
**Highlights:**  
- Merged `legalize_rt.py` ‚Üí `legalize.py`  
- Deleted `events_std.py`, `materialize.py`  
- Added import shims w/ deprecation warnings  
**Tests:** all green  
**Snapshot Tag:** v0.29.0-phase2-baseline  
**Notes:** no functional change, CI verified.

This keeps a human narrative of progress ‚Äî the part no automation can replace.

‚∏ª

üîê 8. Commit & Tag Convention

P<phase>C<checkpoint>: <title>
example: P0C3: Capture baseline artifacts

End-of-phase tags:

v0.<minor>.0-phase<phase>-baseline


‚∏ª

ü™ú 9. Rollback Safety
	‚Ä¢	Each checkpoint commit is atomic and reversible.
	‚Ä¢	Baselines stored under /baselines/phaseX/ allow artifact diffing.
	‚Ä¢	CI remains the arbiter: green before and after every commit.

‚∏ª

ü™∂ 10. Living Documents

After every checkpoint:
	‚Ä¢	CSC_SNAPSHOT.yaml ‚Üí updated automatically by Nova (or manually if no Agent).
	‚Ä¢	CSC_BIBLE.md ‚Üí one-paragraph narrative append.
	‚Ä¢	DEV_WORKFLOW.md ‚Üí rarely changes; acts as constitution.

‚∏ª

üåô 11. Future Expansion

When CrapsSim-Evo integration begins:
	‚Ä¢	Add an ‚ÄúEVO_SYNC‚Äù flag in the snapshot.
	‚Ä¢	Bible gains a second volume (EVO_BIBLE.md).
	‚Ä¢	Workflow pattern remains identical.

# CSC Development Workflow (Agent Mode)

## Purpose
Defines how humans and Agents collaborate on CrapsSim-Control development to ensure deterministic, reversible progress.

---

## 1. Thread / Phase Structure
- **One chat thread = one Phase.**
- **One Agent run = one Checkpoint.**
- Discussions and reasoning happen in chat; Agents perform mechanical work only.

---

## 2. Core Documentation
| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `NOVA_AGENT_ENTRYPOINT.yaml` | Entry pointer for Agent context. |
| `docs/CSC_SNAPSHOT.yaml` | Machine-readable state (phase, checkpoint, version, branch). |
| `docs/PHASE_CHECKLIST.md` | Checklist of current phase tasks. |
| `docs/CSC_BIBLE.md` | Narrative design history and decisions. |
| `docs/DEV_WORKFLOW.md` | This process guide. |

---

## 3. Commit & Tag Rules
- **Commit format:** `P<phase>C<checkpoint>: <title>`
- **End-of-phase tag:** `v0.<minor>.0-phase<phase>-baseline`
- **Example:** `P1C2: defaults toggled` ‚Üí `v0.29.1-phase1-baseline`

---

## 4. Agent Responsibilities
- Read `NOVA_AGENT_ENTRYPOINT.yaml` to orient.
- Apply mechanical edits only (file modifications, test runs, CI updates).
- Leave reasoning and design in chat.
- At end of each run:
  1. Confirm tests green.
  2. Capture any generated artifacts.
  3. Update `CSC_SNAPSHOT.yaml` + `CSC_BIBLE.md`.
  4. Post a concise diff summary.

---

## 5. Human Responsibilities (Rey)
- Start new phase with **Phase Kickoff Playbook**:
  1. Upload repo `.zip`.
  2. Paste kickoff block specifying phase number.
  3. Nova reads entrypoint + docs and proposes checkpoints.
  4. Approve plan ‚Üí Nova bumps docs (`P<X>C0` commit).
- Review Agent output and verify CI green before next checkpoint.

---

## 6. Guardrails
- Keep changes atomic and reversible.
- Never mix semantic design with broad refactors.
- Phase 0 is logic-frozen (no behavioral changes).
- Always maintain deterministic reproducibility.

---

## 7. Goal
A living, versioned system where each checkpoint is test-verified and recoverable, minimizing context loss and merge pain.
