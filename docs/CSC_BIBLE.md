# CrapsSim-Control Bible
A living chronicle of design intent, reasoning, and phase outcomes.

---

## Preface
This document complements `CSC_SNAPSHOT.yaml`.  
Where the snapshot tracks *state*, the Bible records *story*—why decisions were made and what was learned.

## Phase 0 — Staging & Safeguards
**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Objective:** Introduce flags, schema labels, and hygiene with zero behavioral change.  

**Highlights**
- Added runtime flags:  
  - `run.demo_fallbacks=false`  
  - `run.strict=false`  
  - `run.csv.embed_analytics=true`  
- Embedded `journal_schema_version` and `summary_schema_version` (1.1).  
- Strengthened `.gitignore`; purged caches.  
- CI tests remained green throughout.  

**Artifacts**
- Baselines captured under `baselines/phase0/` via `capture_baseline_p0c3.sh`.  
- Tag: `v0.29.0-phase0-baseline`.

**Notes**
- This phase builds the foundation for guarded evolution.  
- No runtime logic altered; repo clean.

## Agent-Mode Transition (October 2025)
Beginning with Phase 1, CrapsSim-Control enters full Agent-mode development.

- Repo entrypoint: `NOVA_AGENT_ENTRYPOINT.yaml`
- Agent responsibilities: mechanical edits, tests, doc updates.
- Human (Rey) responsibilities: planning, reasoning, approvals.
- Documentation hierarchy standardized under `/docs/`.
- Commit / tag / checkpoint discipline enforced via automated workflow.

Phase 0 closed at `v0.29.0-phase0c3-baseline` with deterministic CI verification.
