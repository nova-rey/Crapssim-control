Docs & Metadata
Pass/Fail Table:
1) docs/CSC_SNAPSHOT.yaml lists phase 16, checkpoint 5, status complete, title Hardening & LTS Cut – PASS
2) docs/PHASE_CHECKLIST.md documents Phase 16 checkpoints – PASS
3) docs/CSC_BIBLE.md includes a Phase 16 section – PASS
4) NOVA_AGENT_ENTRYPOINT.yaml marks current_phase 16 and checkpoint 5 – PASS
5) crapssim_control/__init__.py defines __version__ = "1.0.0-lts" – PASS

Schema Freeze
Pass/Fail Table:
1) crapssim_control/schemas.py defines JOURNAL_SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.1" and SUMMARY_SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.1", re-exported by controller – PASS
2) tests/test_schema_freeze.py asserts JOURNAL_SCHEMA_VERSION == "1.1", SUMMARY_SCHEMA_VERSION == "1.1", and __version__.startswith("1.0.") – PASS
Missing or mismatched constants: none observed.

CLI & Runtime
Pass/Fail Table:
1) crapssim_control/cli.py prints both schema versions during run startup and echoes CSC version – PASS

Tooling
Pass/Fail Table:
1) tools/profile_run.py exists and profiles runs, but it calls the CLI parser instead of invoking controller.run(spec) directly – FAIL
2) tools/memory_audit.py uses gc.get_objects() with sys.getsizeof and prints the largest entries – PASS

Lint & Hygiene
Pass/Fail Table:
1) pyproject.toml contains [tool.ruff] configuration – PASS
2) pyproject.toml contains [tool.black] configuration – PASS
3) TODO comments remain in crapssim_control/batch_runner.py and crapssim_control/spec_loader.py – FAIL
4) Risky runtime calls (eval/exec) remain within crapssim_control/eval.py and scripts/release_check.py – FAIL
TODO/FIXME count: 2 TODO comments, 0 FIXME comments.
Risky function calls identified: eval() and exec() in crapssim_control/eval.py; exec() in scripts/release_check.py.

Integrity & Orchestration
Pass/Fail Table:
1) crapssim_control/orchestration/event_bus.py present and syntactically valid – PASS
2) crapssim_control/orchestration/control_surface.py present and syntactically valid – PASS
3) crapssim_control/orchestration/http_bridge.py present and syntactically valid – PASS
4) Baselines directory present with expected contents; no corrupted artifacts detected – PASS

Confirmed version string(s): crapssim_control.__version__ = 1.0.0-lts.

Overall Rating: B
Recommended micro-fixes:
• Update tools/profile_run.py to import the controller module and call controller.run(spec) directly before reporting profiling statistics.
• Remove or resolve the remaining TODO comments in batch_runner.py and spec_loader.py.
• Replace or further sandbox the eval() and exec() usage in eval.py and scripts/release_check.py, or document why they are safe within the LTS scope.
